# TypePaste
### Arduino-powered macro pad for programming and general text-based snippets.

TypePaste is a macro device that helps users save time and effort by allowing them to store text snippets and paste them to their connected computer using physical buttons. Users can easily input and retrieve text, simplifying their workflow and improving their productivity.

After plugging the device into their computer via USB, users can enter up to four text Snippets, tabs and newlines included, to one of the four buttons on the device using the digital interface, built with HTML/CSS/Js. Once the user enters and saves a Snippet, a serial connection is made between the app and the Arduino connected to the device, storing the Snippet into the associated button and illuminating the associated LED green to indicate a successful storage. Users can also modify the name of the Snippet in the app to fit their needs and preferences.

TypePaste is designed to simplify workflows and create a more productive world by saving the digital labor of typing the same things over and over again. It was designed for programmers, but can be used by anybody who has frequent texts that donâ€™t necessarily need to be typed out every single time. From code to chat logs, email formatting, or just simple keyboard shortcuts, TypePaste makes your life easier.
