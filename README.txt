TypePasteDriver.INO must be uploaded to Arduino you intend on using for the device to work.
Obviously, everything must be wired up correctly too - segmented comments in code make connections clear.

Open index.html to access the app.

Make sure Arduino is connected to computer when COM port is requested; otherwise, refresh the page.
